# GitTest

#5/26/2020
No idea how to create readmes. First try I guess.

Okay, it works in github. Not sure yet of how to change it outside of github's interface.

#5/27/2020
Okay, now I'm trying to change the readme using notepad on my computer instead of using Github. 
I want to try and push this change to Github.

Besides that I added played around with Git, branches, staging, and commits.
I added code to go through each letter in each word so I can compare them to the longest word
which I am having trouble on and will work on later this week.

#5/29/2020
Updated the for loops again. I wasn't able to fix the problem, but I thought it would be easier
if I iterated through the longest word first which I found out wouldn't work. Then I had to 
retrieve my original code back that I deleted.

I used the above link to help me delete my current work (It didn't contain anything substantial
to keep) and retrieve my previous commit. 
I also changed "smallest word" to "longest word" as I am meaning to create a longest common 
word program.
I also merged my experimental and master branch.
