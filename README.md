No idea how to create readmes. First try I guess.

Okay, it works in github. Not sure yet of how to change it outside of github's interface.

Okay, now I'm trying to change the readme using notepad on my computer instead of using Github. 
I want to try and push this change to Github.

Besides that I added played around with Git, branches, staging, and commits.
I added code to go through each letter in each word so I can compare them to the longest word
which I am having trouble on and will work on later this week.
